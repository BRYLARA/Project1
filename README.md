Description

Search campsites in your area, determine open or closed status, and Covid regulations.

User story

As an outdoor enthusiast I want to search nearby National Parks for open/close status plus be aware of any restricitons or regulations due to COVID-19 (* COVID-19 is a working idea if we can figure it out).

Who It applies to: Campers/outdoors people searching for spots that are open and able to use at National Parks
What we want to accomplish: a site that is easy to use and have an ability to see where national parks are, and if they are open and available to use.
Some potential features of application: activities in park, locations of park,  directions to park
Using this website will help the user find basic info about the parks and availability.
